# TensorFlow Research Models

This folder contains machine learning models implemented by researchers in
[TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org). The models are maintained by their
respective authors, on [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research). Here on this repository, this models are modifications of the originals adapted to the binary image segmentation of burnt / non burnt areas.

## Models

-   [deeplab](deeplab): deep labeling for semantic image segmentation.
-   [slim](slim): image classification models in TF-Slim.
